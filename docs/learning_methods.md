# Learning Methods & Progression

This guide details how avatars advance skills through different learning methods and how progression is gated by level. It also explains modifiers and burnout mechanics that influence experience gain.

## Level Gating

| Level Range | Primary Learning Methods |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1-3         | Books, online tutorials, YouTube |
| 4-7         | University courses, apprenticeships, bandmates |
| 8-10        | Private tutors, masterclasses |

## Meta-Modifiers

- **Practice Environment:** studio sessions offer higher XP than home practice.
- **Gear Quality:** better instruments and equipment boost learning speed.
- **Mentor Presence:** guidance from skilled players reduces burnout.
- **Lifestyle & Rest:** adequate sleep and low stress maintain high XP rates.

## XP Rates by Method

| Method Category                       | Base XP Rate | Burnout Risk |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Books / Online Tutorials / YouTube    | 1.0x         | Low          |
| University / Apprenticeships / Bandmates | 1.5x     | Medium       |
| Tutors / Masterclasses                | 2.0x         | High         |

## Burnout Mechanics

| Continuous Practice Hours | XP Modifier | Burnout Gain |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| 0-1                       | 0.5x        | 0%           |
| 2-4                       | 1.0x        | 5%           |
| 5-6                       | 1.2x        | 15%          |
| 7+                        | 1.5x        | 30%          |

```
Practice Time -> Fatigue -> Burnout -> XP Penalty
```

This pipeline illustrates how extended practice sessions can lead to fatigue and eventual burnout, reducing XP gains until the avatar recovers.
