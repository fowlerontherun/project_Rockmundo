# Daily Game Loop Enhancements

To encourage players to spend more time in RockMundo and reward them for consistent engagement, the following mechanics are proposed:

1. **Daily Logins & Streak Bonuses**  
   Provide small rewards for logging in each day with increasing value for maintaining streaks.
2. **Rotating Daily Challenges**  
   Offer a mix of quick and extended tasks that change daily to keep gameplay fresh.
3. **Weekly Hour Milestones**  
   Track play time and grant a rotating weekly item when players hit set hour thresholds.
4. **Timed Event Tracks**  
   Run limited-duration events with progress bars and milestone rewards.
5. **Tiered Reward Levels**  
   Introduce reward ladders where higher engagement unlocks better items.
6. **Social & Community Goals**  
   Include cooperative challenges and leaderboards to foster friendly competition.
7. **Session-Based Bonuses**  
   Drop small bonus items after continuous play sessions (e.g., every two hours).
8. **Surprise Bonus Drops**  
   Occasionally grant unexpected rewards at the end of sessions to keep players excited.
9. **Provide Choice and Variety**  
   Let players choose among multiple reward tracks tailored to different play styles.
10. **Ethical Considerations**  
    Keep time requirements reasonable and offer catch-up mechanics so players avoid burnout.

These ideas can be combined into a cohesive daily loop that balances motivation, variety, and player well-being.
