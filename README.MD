# RockMundo Backend

## Overview
RockMundo is a modern music industry simulation game inspired by the depth of legacy titles like Popmundo, rebuilt with a fully featured, modular backend in Python/FastAPI. This backend powers a persistent, multiplayer world where players can create and manage avatars, form bands, record and distribute music, tour globally, and interact with a dynamic, AI-driven simulation.

This document outlines the current state of implemented features, the roadmap for future development, and the architecture that ties it all together.

- Emote models for expressive interactions.

### 3) Bands, Collaborations & Gigs
- Band management with collaboration support for joint songs/albums.
- Gig and live performance tracking.
- Festival history and promotion mechanics.

### 4) Music Content: Songs, Albums, EPs
