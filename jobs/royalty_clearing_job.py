"""Periodic job for settling cover royalties.

This job aggregates outstanding cover royalty transactions and marks them as
paid.  Earnings are distributed to rights holders based on the ``royalties``
split of the original song.  For simplicity the job only updates the
``cover_royalties`` table and prints distributions; integrating with a real
payment system is outside the scope of this module.
